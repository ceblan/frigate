# Updating BIS-IA

The current stable version of BIS-IA is **0.17.0**. The release notes and any breaking changes for this version can be found on the [BIS-IA GitHub releases page](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/bisia/releases/tag/v0.17.0).

Keeping BIS-IA up to date ensures you benefit from the latest features, performance improvements, and bug fixes. The update process varies slightly depending on your installation method (Docker, Home Assistant App, etc.). Below are instructions for the most common setups.

## Before You Begin

- **Stop BIS-IA**: For most methods, you’ll need to stop the running BIS-IA instance before backing up and updating.
- **Backup Your Configuration**: Always back up your `/config` directory (e.g., `config.yml` and `bisia.db`, the SQLite database) before updating. This ensures you can roll back if something goes wrong.
- **Check Release Notes**: Carefully review the [BIS-IA GitHub releases page](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/bisia/releases) for breaking changes or configuration updates that might affect your setup.

## Updating with Docker

If you’re running BIS-IA via Docker (recommended method), follow these steps:

1. **Stop the Container**:
   - If using Docker Compose:
     ```bash
     docker compose down bisia
     ```
   - If using `docker run`:
     ```bash
     docker stop bisia
     ```

2. **Update and Pull the Latest Image**:
   - If using Docker Compose:
     - Edit your `docker-compose.yml` file to specify the desired version tag (e.g., `0.17.0` instead of `0.16.4`). For example:
       ```yaml
       services:
         bisia:
           image: ghcr.io/blakeblackshear/bisia:0.17.0
       ```
     - Then pull the image:
       ```bash
       docker pull ghcr.io/blakeblackshear/bisia:0.17.0
       ```
     - **Note for `stable` Tag Users**: If your `docker-compose.yml` uses the `stable` tag (e.g., `ghcr.io/blakeblackshear/bisia:stable`), you don’t need to update the tag manually. The `stable` tag always points to the latest stable release after pulling.
   - If using `docker run`:
     - Pull the image with the appropriate tag (e.g., `0.17.0`, `0.17.0-tensorrt`, or `stable`):
       ```bash
       docker pull ghcr.io/blakeblackshear/bisia:0.17.0
       ```

3. **Start the Container**:
   - If using Docker Compose:
     ```bash
     docker compose up -d
     ```
   - If using `docker run`, re-run your original command (e.g., from the [Installation](./installation.md#docker) section) with the updated image tag.

4. **Verify the Update**:
   - Check the container logs to ensure BIS-IA starts successfully:
     ```bash
     docker logs bisia
     ```
   - Visit the BIS-IA Web UI (default: `http://<your-ip>:5000`) to confirm the new version is running. The version number is displayed at the top of the System Metrics page.

### Notes

- If you’ve customized other settings (e.g., `shm-size`), ensure they’re still appropriate after the update.
- Docker will automatically use the updated image when you restart the container, as long as you pulled the correct version.

## Updating the Home Assistant App (formerly Addon)

For users running BIS-IA as a Home Assistant App:

1. **Check for Updates**:
   - Navigate to **Settings > Apps** in Home Assistant.
   - Find your installed BIS-IA app (e.g., "BIS-IA NVR" or "BIS-IA NVR (Full Access)").
   - If an update is available, you’ll see an "Update" button.

2. **Update the App**:
   - Click the "Update" button next to the BIS-IA app.
   - Wait for the process to complete. Home Assistant will handle downloading and installing the new version.

3. **Restart the App**:
   - After updating, go to the app’s page and click "Restart" to apply the changes.

4. **Verify the Update**:
   - Check the app logs (under the "Log" tab) to ensure BIS-IA starts without errors.
   - Access the BIS-IA Web UI to confirm the new version is running.

### Notes

- Ensure your `/config/bisia.yml` is compatible with the new version by reviewing the [Release notes](https://github.com/blakeblackshear/bisia/releases).
- If using custom hardware (e.g., Coral or GPU), verify that configurations still work, as app updates don’t modify your hardware settings.

## Rolling Back

If an update causes issues:

1. Stop BIS-IA.
2. Restore your backed-up config file and database.
3. Revert to the previous image version:
   - For Docker: Specify an older tag (e.g., `ghcr.io/blakeblackshear/bisia:0.16.4`) in your `docker run` command.
   - For Docker Compose: Edit your `docker-compose.yml`, specify the older version tag (e.g., `ghcr.io/blakeblackshear/bisia:0.16.4`), and re-run `docker compose up -d`.
   - For Home Assistant: Restore from the app/addon backup you took before you updated.
4. Verify the old version is running again.

## Troubleshooting

- **Container Fails to Start**: Check logs (`docker logs bisia`) for errors.
- **UI Not Loading**: Ensure ports (e.g., 5000, 8971) are still mapped correctly and the service is running.
- **Hardware Issues**: Revisit hardware-specific setup (e.g., Coral, GPU) if detection or decoding fails post-update.
